    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    console.log('Use slice, concat or ES6 Spread');

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'heeee hawww';

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    console.log('Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects');
    console.log('Lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.');
